content: 'I am a recent Computer Science Undergrad from IIIT Raipur. Apart from being a technical buff, I am a classical Bharatnatyam dancer (completed VID equivalent to B.Tech degree), painter, try to pour out my thoughts through my writings and currently, trying my hands on guitar.
If you cannot find me, it is probably because I am reading a book in a silent corner, off to exercising & cycling or occupied with thoughts with headphones on, listening to soulful music.
The keywords which I believe in are passion, thoughtprocess & smart-hard work.'
